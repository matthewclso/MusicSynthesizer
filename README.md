# MusicSynthesizer

This runs on a Google Colab instance working off of Google Drive (it has just been imported to github for visibility). Feel free to use, just make sure to configure directory locations so they work for your environment.

This project uses the MusicNet dataset from UW CSE.  You can find more here - https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/musicnet.html
